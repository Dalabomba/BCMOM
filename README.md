# BCMOM
BCMOM, i.e., Bias Corrected Median of Means, is a new Byzantine robust estimator. If lucky, our work will be accepted to ICML 2024.

_**BCMOM.py**_ contains the packages requiries and the class of MOM, VRMOM and the proposed BCMOM estimators.

_**demo.py**_ provides a demo of our simulation.
